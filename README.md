# stress-test


This pipeline is used to stress test the Nextflow execution engine. It
runs a series of tasks that consume a large amount of memory, disk
space, and time to see which exit codes are returned.

## Stress test code

Build components

``` bash
viash ns build --setup cb
```

    Exporting stress =docker=> target/docker/stress
    [notice] Building container 'stress:latest' with Dockerfile
    Exporting stress =nextflow=> target/nextflow/stress
    All 2 configs built successfully

Clean up previous runs

Create a parameter file

``` bash
cat > /tmp/params.yaml <<EOF
param_list:
  - id: memory
    mode: memory
  - id: time
    mode: time
  - id: disk
    mode: disk
EOF
```

Run the pipeline

``` bash
nextflow run target/nextflow/stress/main.nf \
  -profile docker,no_publish \
  -params-file /tmp/params.yaml \
  -with-trace trace.log
```
